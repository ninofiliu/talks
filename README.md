# Talks

Source materials from talks I gave here and there

- [Weird Web APIs I love to use when making art in the browser](./weird-apis.pdf)
- [ICAN Lab Research](./ican-lab-research.pdf)

Presentations are powered by [Slidev](https://sli.dev/), so you can also run them locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ninofiliu/talks
cd talks
pnpm install
pnpm slidev weird-apis # or other
```
