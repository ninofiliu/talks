# Talks

Source materials from talks I gave here and there

- [Weird Web APIs I love to use when making art in the browser](./weird-apis/)

Presentations are powered by [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) so there is one folder per talk that you can either

- read in markdown format (in `slides.md` of each folder)
- read rendered slides (in `slides-export.pdf` of each folder)
- run locally
  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:ninofiliu/talks
  cd talks/weird-apis # or other talks
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
  ```
